# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Integrate lookout agent with AIChatPanel

## Task Overview
Task 5 required integrating the lookout agent with AIChatPanel to detect lookout commands, manage modal state, prevent normal chat submission for lookout commands, integrate with the existing highlighted text context system, and ensure no interference with normal chat functionality.

## Requirements Addressed

### ✅ Requirement 1.3: Modal Interface Integration
- **Implementation**: AIChatPanel now opens the LookoutAgent modal when lookout commands are detected
- **Code Location**: `AIChatPanel.tsx` lines 284-292 and 791-798
- **Verification**: Modal opens with proper question and context data

### ✅ Requirement 5.1: Command Detection Without Interference
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `detectLookoutCommand` import and usage in `sendPrompt` function
  - Lookout commands are detected before normal chat processing
  - Normal chat continues unaffected when no lookout command is present
- **Code Location**: `AIChatPanel.tsx` lines 7, 283-292
- **Verification**: Tests confirm normal chat vs lookout command differentiation

### ✅ Requirement 5.3: Context System Integration
- **Implementation**: 
  - `detectLookoutCommand` receives `contextSnippets` from existing chat store
  - Highlighted text context is properly combined and passed to modal
- **Code Location**: `AIChatPanel.tsx` line 283
- **Verification**: Context integration tests pass

### ✅ Requirement 5.5: No Interference with Normal Chat
- **Implementation**:
  - Lookout detection happens early in `sendPrompt` with early return
  - Input is cleared only for lookout commands
  - Normal chat flow continues unchanged for non-lookout inputs
- **Code Location**: `AIChatPanel.tsx` lines 283-294
- **Verification**: All existing chat functionality remains intact

## Implementation Details

### 1. Command Detection Integration
```typescript
// Check if this is a lookout command
const lookoutCommand = detectLookoutCommand(prompt, contextSnippets);
if (lookoutCommand.isLookoutCommand) {
  // Handle lookout command by opening the modal
  setLookoutQuestion(lookoutCommand.question);
  setLookoutContext(lookoutCommand.highlightedContext);
  setLookoutModalOpen(true);
  
  // Clear input since we detected the command
  setInput(bookKey, '');
  return;
}
```

### 2. State Management
```typescript
// Lookout agent state management
const [lookoutModalOpen, setLookoutModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [lookoutQuestion, setLookoutQuestion] = useState('');
const [lookoutContext, setLookoutContext] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
```

### 3. Modal Integration
```typescript
{/* Lookout Agent Modal */}
<LookoutAgent
  isOpen={lookoutModalOpen}
  onClose={() => setLookoutModalOpen(false)}
  question={lookoutQuestion}
  context={lookoutContext}
  bookKey={bookKey}
/>
```

### 4. User Experience Enhancement
- Added placeholder text: `'Ask AI… (or @lookout <question> to search web)'`
- Provides clear guidance on how to use the lookout feature

## Sub-task Completion Status

### ✅ Modify AIChatPanel.tsx to detect lookout commands in chat input
- **Status**: Complete
- **Implementation**: Added `detectLookoutCommand` import and usage in `sendPrompt`
- **Location**: Lines 7, 283

### ✅ Add state management for lookout modal visibility and data
- **Status**: Complete  
- **Implementation**: Added three state variables for modal management
- **Location**: Lines 274-276

### ✅ Prevent normal chat submission when lookout command is detected
- **Status**: Complete
- **Implementation**: Early return in `sendPrompt` when lookout command detected
- **Location**: Lines 284-294

### ✅ Integrate with existing highlighted text context system
- **Status**: Complete
- **Implementation**: Pass `contextSnippets` from chat store to `detectLookoutCommand`
- **Location**: Line 283

### ✅ Ensure lookout agent doesn't interfere with normal chat functionality
- **Status**: Complete
- **Implementation**: Conditional handling with early return for lookout commands
- **Location**: Lines 283-294

## Testing Verification

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 15 tests for command detection utility
- **Integration Tests**: 24 tests for lookout command integration
