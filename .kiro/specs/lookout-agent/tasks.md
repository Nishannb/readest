  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1_

- [x] 3. Create LookoutAgent modal component
  - Create `LookoutAgent.tsx` component with modal overlay and proper styling
  - Implement state management for different stages (generating, searching, results, error)
  - Add loading states with appropriate animations and indicators
  - Create results display with type indicators for videos, articles, and links
  - Add close functionality with click outside and X button
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 4. Implement AI query generation service
  - Create function to generate optimal search queries using existing AI providers
  - Implement the specific prompt template for search query generation
  - Add integration with existing `useAIProviderStore` for model selection
  - Implement fallback logic when AI generation fails
  - Add timeout handling for AI requests
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Integrate lookout agent with AIChatPanel
  - Modify `AIChatPanel.tsx` to detect lookout commands in chat input
  - Add state management for lookout modal visibility and data
  - Prevent normal chat submission when lookout command is detected
  - Integrate with existing highlighted text context system
  - Ensure lookout agent doesn't interfere with normal chat functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 5.1, 5.3, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Add graceful fallback when AI model fails to generate search query
  - Implement user-friendly error messages for DuckDuckGo API failures
  - Add network timeout handling with appropriate user feedback
  - Create retry mechanism for failed operations
  - Add error logging for debugging while maintaining user experience
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 7. Add result interaction and navigation
  - Implement click handlers to open search results in default browser
  - Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility
  - Create proper link handling for different result types (videos, articles, links)
  - Add visual feedback for interactive elements
  - Ensure proper focus management in modal
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Style and polish the user interface
  - Apply consistent styling with existing chat interface design patterns
  - Add proper icons for different result types (video, article, link)
  - Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
  - Add hover states and transitions for better user experience
  - Ensure accessibility compliance with ARIA labels and semantic HTML
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.4_

- [x] 9. Add performance optimizations
  - Implement request cancellation for abandoned searches
  - Add debouncing for command detection to avoid unnecessary processing
  - Optimize modal component loading and rendering
  - Add session-based caching for identical search queries
  - Implement proper cleanup for event listeners and timers
  - _Requirements: Performance considerations from design_

- [x] 10. Create comprehensive tests and validation
  - Write unit tests for command detection regex patterns
  - Test AI query generation with various input scenarios
  - Validate DuckDuckGo API integration and response parsing
  - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Perform end-to-end testing of the complete lookout workflow
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
