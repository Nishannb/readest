# Server-Side Payment Verification System

This document explains how the app handles payment verification when localStorage is cleared or corrupted, ensuring users never lose access to a product they paid for.

## 🚨 **The Problem**

**Before this system:** If a user cleared their browser cache, localStorage, or reinstalled the app, they would lose access to the product they paid for and be forced to pay again.

**This is unacceptable** for a paid product and creates:
- Poor user experience
- Support tickets
- Potential chargebacks
- User frustration

## ✅ **The Solution**

**Server-side payment verification** that automatically restores user access when localStorage is missing or corrupted.

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### 1. **Normal Flow (localStorage intact)**
```
App Start → Check localStorage → User has paid → Access granted
```

### 2. **Recovery Flow (localStorage cleared)**
```
App Start → Check localStorage → No payment data found
         → Attempt server verification → User verified → Restore access
         → If verification fails → Redirect to onboarding
```

## 🏗️ **Implementation Details**

### **Payment Store (`src/store/paymentStore.ts`)**
- Added `userId` and `email` storage
- Added `verifyPaymentWithServer()` method
- Enhanced persistence with hydration tracking

### **Payment Service (`src/services/payment.ts`)**
- Added `checkPaymentStatus()` method
- Calls Lambda API to verify payment status
- Handles cross-platform HTTP requests

### **Payment Guard (`src/hooks/usePaymentGuard.ts`)**
- Automatically attempts server verification when localStorage is empty
- Shows appropriate loading states during verification
- Gracefully falls back to onboarding if verification fails

### **Protected Routes**
- Wait for both hydration and server verification
- Show "Verifying access..." during server checks
- Prevent premature routing decisions

## 🌐 **Lambda API Requirements**

Your Lambda function needs a new endpoint:

```python
def check_payment_status(data):
    """
    Check if a user has paid for the app.
    
    Args:
        data: {
            "userId": "user_123",
            "email": "user@example.com", 
            "appVersion": "0.9.71",
            "platform": "desktop"
        }
    
    Returns:
        {
            "success": true,
            "hasPaid": true,
            "amount": 1000,
            "currency": "usd",
            "customer_email": "user@example.com",
            "payment_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
        }
    """
    # Query your Stripe database/customer records
    # Return payment status for this user
    pass
```

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### **Fail-Safe Design**
- **Never grants access** if server verification fails
- **Requires valid user info** (userId + email) for verification
- **Graceful degradation** to onboarding flow

### **User Identification**
- **Unique userId** generated on first payment
- **Email address** from Stripe payment
- **App version** and **platform** for tracking

### **Verification Process**
- **Server-side only** - no client-side payment validation
- **Stripe integration** - uses your existing payment infrastructure
- **Rate limiting** - prevents abuse of verification endpoints

## 📱 **User Experience**

### **Seamless Recovery**
- User clears cache → App automatically verifies with server
- If verified → Access restored immediately
- If not verified → Redirected to onboarding

### **Loading States**
- **"Loading..."** - While store hydrates
- **"Verifying access..."** - While checking with server
- **"Checking access..."** - While determining route

### **No Interruption**
- Users never see payment screens again after paying
- Automatic recovery from system issues
- Professional, reliable experience

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### **1. Test Normal Flow**
```bash
# Pay normally, verify access works
pnpm tauri dev
# Complete payment → Access granted
```

### **2. Test Recovery Flow**
```bash
# Clear localStorage (simulate cache clear)
# In browser dev tools: localStorage.clear()
# Restart app → Should verify with server
```

### **3. Test Server Failure**
```bash
# Disconnect internet or modify Lambda
# App should gracefully fall back to onboarding
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] **Lambda function** has `check_payment_status` endpoint
- [ ] **Stripe webhooks** are properly configured
- [ ] **User database** stores payment records
- [ ] **CORS** allows desktop app requests
- [ ] **Error handling** is robust and secure

## 💡 **Best Practices**

### **For Lambda Function**
- **Cache results** to reduce Stripe API calls
- **Log verification attempts** for debugging
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Use Stripe Customer IDs** when possible

### **For Desktop App**
- **Store minimal user info** (userId + email only)
- **Handle network failures** gracefully
- **Show clear loading states** during verification
- **Log verification attempts** for debugging

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

### **Advanced Recovery**
- **Multiple verification methods** (email, device ID, etc.)
- **Offline verification** for critical apps
- **Biometric verification** for mobile apps

### **User Management**
- **Account creation** after payment
- **Multiple device support**
- **Subscription upgrades/downgrades**

## 📞 **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Verification always fails** → Check Lambda logs
2. **User stuck in loading** → Check network connectivity
3. **Access not restored** → Verify user info in store

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check payment store state
console.log(usePaymentStore.getState())

# Check hydration status
console.log(usePaymentStoreHydrated())

# Test server verification manually
const store = usePaymentStore.getState()
await store.verifyPaymentWithServer()
```

This system ensures your users never lose access to a product they paid for, creating a professional and reliable experience that builds trust and reduces support overhead.
