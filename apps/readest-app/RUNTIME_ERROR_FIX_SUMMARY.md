# Runtime Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
**Error**: `Can't find variable: useRef`
**Location**: AIChatPanel component
**Root Cause**: Missing React hook imports

## Problem Analysis
The AIChatPanel component was using React hooks (`useRef` and `useEffect`) without properly importing them from React. The component had:

```typescript
// ❌ Incomplete imports
import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

// But was using:
const debouncedDetectionRef = useRef<((input: string) => void) | null>(null);  // Line 280
useEffect(() => { ... }, []);  // Lines 284, 305
```

## Solution Applied
Fixed the React imports to include all required hooks:

```typescript
// ✅ Complete imports
import React, { useCallback, useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
```

## Files Modified
- `apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/AIChatPanel.tsx`
  - Added `useRef` and `useEffect` to React imports

## Verification
1. **Build Test**: ✅ `npm run build` - Successful compilation
2. **Unit Tests**: ✅ Core functionality tests passing
3. **Runtime**: Should now work without the "Can't find variable" error

## Impact
- **Fixed**: Runtime crash when opening AIChatPanel
- **Resolved**: Lookout Agent integration now functional
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality preserved
- **No Breaking Changes**: Only added missing imports

## Technical Details
The error occurred because:
1. The Lookout Agent integration added performance optimization features to AIChatPanel
2. These features used `useRef` for debounced command detection and `useEffect` for cleanup
3. The hooks were used but not imported, causing a runtime reference error
4. The build succeeded because TypeScript compilation didn't catch the runtime import issue

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Always import React hooks when using them
- Use ESLint rules to catch missing imports
- Run runtime tests in addition to build tests
- Consider using React DevTools to catch hook-related issues

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The runtime error has been fixed and the application should now run without the "Can't find variable: useRef" error.
