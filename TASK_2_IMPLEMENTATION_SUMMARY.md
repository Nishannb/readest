# Task 2: Command Detection Logic - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the command detection logic for the Lookout Agent feature. This task focused on detecting `@lookout <question>` commands in the AI chat input and integrating with the existing context system.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/utils/lookoutCommandDetection.ts`**
   - Core command detection utilities
   - Functions: `detectLookoutCommand`, `isValidLookoutCommand`, `extractQuestionFromLookoutCommand`
   - Handles regex pattern matching for `@lookout <question>` commands
   - Integrates with highlighted text context

2. **`apps/readest-app/src/__tests__/utils/lookoutCommandDetection.test.ts`**
   - Unit tests for command detection functions
   - 15 comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios

3. **`apps/readest-app/src/__tests__/integration/lookout-command-integration.test.ts`**
   - Integration tests for command detection scenarios
   - 11 test cases covering real-world usage patterns

4. **`apps/readest-app/src/__tests__/integration/lookout-command-requirements-validation.test.ts`**
   - Requirements validation tests
   - 13 test cases specifically validating requirements 1.1, 1.2, 5.1, and 1.6

### Modified Files:
1. **`apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/AIChatPanel.tsx`**
   - Added import for `detectLookoutCommand`
   - Modified `sendPrompt` function to detect lookout commands
   - Prevents normal chat submission when lookout command is detected
   - Updated placeholder text to indicate lookout command support
   - Added console logging for detected commands (for debugging)

## Implementation Details

### Command Detection Logic
- **Regex Pattern**: `/^@lookout\s+([\s\S]+)$/i`
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Supports multiline questions using `[\s\S]+`
  - Requires whitespace after `@lookout`
  - Captures the entire question portion

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Command Detection**: Detects `@lookout <question>` at the start of input
2. **Question Extraction**: Extracts the question portion from valid commands
3. **Context Integration**: Combines highlighted text context with user questions
4. **Validation**: Ensures command format is correct before processing
5. **Non-interference**: Normal chat messages are unaffected by command detection

### Integration Points:
- **AI Chat Store**: Uses existing `contextSnippets` from `useAIChatStore`
- **Input Handling**: Integrated into existing `sendPrompt` function
- **Context System**: Leverages existing highlighted text context system
- **UI Feedback**: Updated placeholder text to guide users

## Requirements Satisfied

### ✅ Requirement 1.1
**WHEN a user types `@lookout <question>` in the chat input THEN the system SHALL detect the command and extract the question**
- Implemented regex pattern matching
- Extracts question portion accurately
- Handles various question formats and punctuation

### ✅ Requirement 1.2  
**WHEN the lookout command is detected AND there is highlighted text context THEN the system SHALL combine both the highlighted text and user question for research**
- Integrates with existing `contextSnippets` array
- Combines multiple context snippets with `\n\n` separator
- Preserves both question and context for future processing

### ✅ Requirement 5.1
**WHEN the user types in the chat input THEN the system SHALL detect `@lookout` commands without interfering with normal chat**
- Normal chat messages are unaffected
- Only processes valid lookout commands
- Maintains existing chat functionality

### ✅ Requirement 1.6 (Implicit)
**When the lookout command is detected even when the highlighted text context are not added by user, lookout command still search on web based on what user asked in the prompt**
- Works with empty context arrays
- Processes questions without requiring highlighted text
- Gracefully handles missing context

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (15 tests)
- Basic command detection
- Case sensitivity handling
- Context integration
- Edge cases and validation
- Question extraction accuracy

### Integration Tests (11 tests)
- Real-world usage scenarios
- Context handling with multiple snippets
- Command format validation
- Error handling

### Requirements Validation (13 tests)
- Specific requirement validation
- Edge case handling
- Integration with existing systems
- Format validation

## Technical Decisions

### Regex Pattern Choice
- Used `[\s\S]+` instead of `.+` to support multiline questions
- Case-insensitive matching for better user experience
- Anchored pattern (`^` and `$`) to ensure command is at start/end

### Context Integration
- Leveraged existing `contextSnippets` array from AI chat store
- Used `\n\n` separator for multiple context snippets
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing context system

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of invalid commands
- Empty context arrays handled properly
- Whitespace trimming for robust parsing

## Future Integration Points
This implementation provides the foundation for:
- **Task 3**: LookoutAgent modal component (will use the detected command data)
- **Task 4**: AI query generation service (will use the question and context)
- **Task 5**: Integration with AIChatPanel (already partially complete)

## Testing Results
- ✅ All 103 tests passing
- ✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Requirements validation complete
- ✅ Integration tests passing

## Usage Example
```typescript
// User types: "@lookout explain quantum computing"
const result = detectLookoutCommand("@lookout explain quantum computing", contextSnippets);
// Result: {
//   isLookoutCommand: true,
//   question: "explain quantum computing",
//   highlightedContext: "Selected text about quantum mechanics..." // if context exists
// }
```

The command detection logic is now fully implemented and ready for integration with the next tasks in the implementation plan.
