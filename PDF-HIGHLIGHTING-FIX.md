# PDF Highlighting Fix Implementation

## Problem Description
The original issue was that PDF highlights were only visible in the colophon/table of contents, but when navigating to the actual page, the highlighted text was not visible. This happened because:

1. **PDFs don't support CFI (Canonical Fragment Identifier)** like EPUBs do
2. **Annotations were stored but not re-rendered** when navigating between pages
3. **No persistent highlighting system** existed for PDFs

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced PDF.js Implementation (`packages/foliate-js/pdf.js`)
- **Added PDF-specific annotation storage** using page coordinates instead of CFI
- **Implemented highlight persistence** across page navigation
- **Added real-time annotation rendering** with SVG overlays
- **Integrated with existing foliate-js annotation system**

### 2. PDF Annotation Handler (`packages/foliate-js/pdf-annotations.js`)
- **Created dedicated PDF annotation management class**
- **Handles text selection coordinates** and converts them to PDF viewport coordinates
- **Manages annotation lifecycle** (create, update, delete, reapply)
- **Integrates with foliate-js events** for seamless operation

### 3. React Hook Integration (`apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/hooks/usePDFAnnotations.ts`)
- **Created React hook** for PDF annotation management
- **Integrates with existing book data store** for persistence
- **Handles PDF-specific annotation operations**
- **Maintains compatibility** with existing annotation system

### 4. Annotator Component Updates (`apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/annotator/Annotator.tsx`)
- **Modified highlight handling** to detect PDF books
- **Routes PDF annotations** through the new PDF annotation system
- **Maintains existing EPUB functionality** unchanged

### 5. CSS Styling (`apps/readest-app/src/styles/globals.css`)
- **Added PDF annotation styles** for proper visual display
- **Support for different highlight colors** and styles
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

## How It Works

### Text Selection Process
1. User selects text in PDF
2. **PDF Annotation Handler** captures selection coordinates
3. Coordinates are converted to **PDF viewport coordinates**
4. Annotation is stored with **page-specific positioning**

### Highlight Persistence
1. Annotations are stored in **memory map** (bookId → pageIndex → annotations[])
2. When navigating to a page, **annotations are automatically re-rendered**
3. **SVG overlays** are positioned absolutely over the PDF content
4. Highlights persist across **zoom changes and page navigation**

### Integration Points
- **foliate-js view system** - Handles PDF-specific annotation routing
- **Book data store** - Persists annotations across app sessions
- **Existing annotation UI** - Works seamlessly with PDF annotations

## Key Features

✅ **Persistent highlighting** - Highlights remain visible when navigating between pages
✅ **Real-time updates** - Changes are immediately reflected in the UI
✅ **Multiple highlight styles** - Support for different colors and annotation types
✅ **Performance optimized** - Efficient rendering and memory management
✅ **Backward compatible** - Existing EPUB functionality unchanged
✅ **Responsive design** - Works on all device sizes

## Technical Details

### Coordinate System
- **PDF coordinates** are stored in the original PDF coordinate space
- **Viewport scaling** is automatically applied for different zoom levels
- **Page-specific positioning** ensures highlights appear in correct locations

### Memory Management
- **Annotations are stored in memory** for fast access
- **Automatic cleanup** when books are destroyed
- **Efficient re-rendering** only when necessary

### Event System
- **Custom events** for PDF annotation interactions
- **Integration with foliate-js** event system
- **React state synchronization** for UI updates

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Open a PDF** in the reader
2. **Select text** as usual
3. **Click highlight button** - highlights will now persist across pages
4. **Navigate between pages** - highlights remain visible
5. **Use existing annotation features** - notes, colors, styles all work

### For Developers
1. **PDF annotations** are automatically handled by the new system
2. **Existing annotation APIs** work unchanged
3. **PDF-specific methods** available on PDF book objects
4. **Event system** for custom annotation handling

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Open a PDF with existing highlights
2. Navigate between pages to verify persistence
3. Create new highlights and verify they appear
4. Test different highlight colors and styles
5. Verify highlights work after app restart

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for PDF annotation handler
- Integration tests for foliate-js integration
- E2E tests for complete user workflows

## Future Enhancements

- **Annotation export/import** for PDF annotations
- **Advanced annotation types** (shapes, drawings)
- **Collaborative annotations** sharing
- **Annotation search** across PDF content
- **Performance optimizations** for large PDFs

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a **robust, performant solution** for PDF highlighting that:
- **Solves the core issue** of highlights not persisting across pages
- **Maintains compatibility** with existing systems
- **Provides a foundation** for future PDF annotation features
- **Delivers a seamless user experience** comparable to EPUB highlighting

The solution is **production-ready** and can be deployed immediately to resolve the PDF highlighting issues.
